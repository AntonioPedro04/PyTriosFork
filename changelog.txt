Xmas project: Completely revamped PyTrios library.

Major refactoring: main functionality wrapped in TChannel and TPacket classes in TClasses.py:
- TPacket identifies what sort of packet (query, measurement, config) a sensor sent
- TChannel represents a single module 
- TChannel instances are collected in the tchannel dictionary which no longer requires you to track which sensor is linked to which serial port (see example)
- tpackethandler links tpackets to previously identified tchannels
- most common commands for SAM sensors are brought under their respective TChannel subclass, TSAM
- most common commands for MicroFlu are not yet integrated (because I don't have the sensors)
- TChannel offers two ways to monitor measurement progress (tchannel.is_finished() and tchannel.is_pending())

The front-end (PyTrios.py) is now limited to the active monitoring of COM ports and subsequent handling of packets

An example/template of a fairly elaborate multiple RAMSES sensor configuration over an IPS box is included.
