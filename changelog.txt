changed in version 20140203:
- Refactoring and code cleanup. Some external changes, too:
- TClose now closes any open threads before closing COM ports
- TchannelDict is now called Tchannels
- Instrument equipped with multiple modules (SAMIP) report results back on the address of the master module, this should prevent any trouble with SAMIP sensor modules not identifying themselves after a 'warm' start.
- Tchannel class changed and now holds subclasses TSAM, TMicroFlu, and TInfo, allowing easier browsing.
- new subclasses TSAM and TMicroFlu contain sensor-specific configuration in their own Settings subclasses. 
- Most important external changes of the refactoring steps:
	- Tchannel[address].TInfo.serialn = sensor serial number
	- Tchannel[address].TInfo.ModuleType = type of (master) instrument, e.g. MicroFlu, SAM, or SAMIP
	- Tchannel[address].TSAM.lastRawSAM and lastRawSAMTime hold the last spectrum and timestamp
	- Tchannel[address].TMicroFlu.Settings.Ftype is the type of MicroFlu sensor (1 Chl, 2 Blue, 3 CDOM)
	- Tchannel[address].TMicroFlu.lastFluRaw, lastFluCal, and lastFluTime hold latest MicroFlu data
	- Tchannel[address].TInfo, Tchannel[address].TMicroFlu, and Tchannel[address].TSAM can be called directly for basic sensor
